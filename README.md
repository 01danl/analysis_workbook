# Research

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks focused on data analysis, machine learning experiments, and other research-related tasks. Each notebook explores different aspects of data science, algorithm development, or theoretical concepts.

## Goals

- Conduct in-depth research on data science topics, machine learning, and algorithms.
- Document the research process and findings in a reproducible format using Jupyter Notebooks.
- Experiment with different approaches and algorithms, and analyze their performance.
- Present clear and actionable insights through visualizations, charts, and summary reports.
- Provide accessible and well-documented code that can be easily reused or built upon.
